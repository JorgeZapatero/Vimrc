# Vimrc
To make us the file 'vimrc' in the is repo work as your '.vimrc' in your home directory (notice the leading '.')
I suggest:
1) Clone the repo
2) Create a sym link called '.vimrc' in your home directory that
> ln -s .../Vimrc/vimrc ~/.vimrc

Now when you pull this repo, it will also update your .vimrc
